            <h2>Truth Behind Taxi Fares on Bank Holidays</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how taxi fares are calculated? 

It can be a little confusing, but understanding the process can help you avoid getting a shock at the end of the ride. Most taxi fares are calculated using a combination of the following:  

Distance and time: 

The initial fare is for the first few kilometers or minutes of the taxi ride, after which the fare increases with the distance traveled or time expended in the taxi.  

Day or week time (higher fares during rush hour or  weekends):

Some cities also have a minimum fare, which means you have to pay a certain amount extra even for short journeys. Please note that additional costs such as tolls or airport taxes may also be included in the taxi prices.</p>
